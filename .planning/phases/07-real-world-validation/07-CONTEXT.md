# Phase 7: Real-World Validation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Personal sound design sessions using the tool for real creative work. Not structured tests or benchmarks — just using audio-loop to make actual sounds and observing the experience.

The real measure of success is outcome quality: do the sounds I create turn out better because of this tool? All the metrics and speed improvements from v2.0 are meaningless if they don't translate to better creative results.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Honest assessment** — Genuinely discover what works and what doesn't, not just confirm assumptions
- **Outcome quality** — The sounds produced should actually be better than they would be without the tool

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Publishing results — this is personal notes, not a public writeup
- Formal benchmarking with stopwatch timing (if it feels faster, that's what matters)

Note: Fixing issues found during validation is NOT explicitly out of scope — if something's broken or needs improvement, that could inform future work.

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to whatever emerges from actual use.

## Additional Context

This is a validation phase, not a coding phase. The goal is dogfooding — using the tool for real work to learn whether v2.0 actually tightened the feedback loop in practice.
